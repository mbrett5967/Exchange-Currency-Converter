# Currency and and Exchange rate converter

LInk to App:
https://github.com/mbrett5967/ConsoleApp2/blob/main/CurrencyConvert.cs

 --- Summary --- 

I created a small exchange rate converter that initially was mean't to be expanded on with UI elemnts. However, I started to experiment with Co-pilot. My goal was to eventually link this via an API to pull live rates and use this within the app. This was both for my learning experience and also part of my goal, which was to eventually move into .NET MAUI and publish on IOS.

I found Co-pilot to be overly helpful in many ways, and although I would admit now that it is not something I will use going forward, as it leads to poor habbits. I want to learn and be proficient with this language and I discovered Co-pilot can make my code slightly less readable and hard to follow. It was however exceptional in helping me understand API keys and explaining specific errors I was getting. Being able to glance over the problems I had listed in the editor, right clicking and asking Co-pilot to explain is extremely helpful to a new learner such as myself.

---- What I learned----
* ✅API key implementation
* ✅Further excpetion awareness and handling
* ✅Co-pilot ,it's merits and faults
* ✅New namespace libraries
* ✅and much more


 ----Improvements----
 * User interface, transitioning from Console based app
 * More rate exchanges
 * Perhaps implementing a method to pull several rates at once.
 * allow user to change initial currency from GBP
