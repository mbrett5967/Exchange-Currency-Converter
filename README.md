--- Summary --- 


I created a small exchange rate converter that initially was setup as a very basic console application. I then decided to convert this into a desktop application with UI, as part of my learning experience. The emergence of AI, also gave me an opportunity to use co-pilot as an aid in this process and experience it's capability.

I found Co-pilot to be overly helpful in many ways, and although I would admit now, that it is not something I will use, "heavily" going forward (from a learning perspective). I am eager to learn and be proficient with this language and I discovered Co-pilot can make my code slightly less readable and hard to follow. It was however, exceptional in helping me understand API keys and explaining specific errors I was getting. Being able to glance over the problems I had, listed in the editor, right clicking and asking Co-pilot to explain, is extremely helpful to a new learner such as myself.

I will be continuing with this and expanding on it to further my progression. Starting firstly, with an Avalonia merge and bringing this console app, to be a proficient desktop application accompanied with a decent front-end. 

--- What I learned---
* ~~✅API key implementation~~  ✅Keyless REST API endpoint
* ✅Further excpetion awareness and handling
* ✅Co-pilot ,it's merits and faults
* ✅New namespace libraries
* ✅and much more


---Improvements---
 * User interface, transitioning from Console based app -- $${\color{blue}\text{In\ Progress}}$$
 * Front-end Development -- $${\color{blue}\text{In\ Progress}}$$
 * More rate exchanges -- $${\color{red}\text{Not\ Started}}$$
 * Perhaps implementing a method to pull several rates at once -- $${\color{red}\text{Not\ Started}}$$
 * allow user to change initial currency from GBP -- $${\color{blue}\text{In\ Progress}}$$
